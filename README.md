# Elastic Search Workshop 2019

## Intro - What is ElasticSearch? üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

[Link to slides]()

## Setup Kibana to interact with local ElasticSearch indices

Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f ops/docker-compose.es-admin.yml up -d`

Your local ElasticSearch will run on `localhost:9200` or `localhost:9202`

Visit `localhost:9202/_cat/indices` to verify there are local indices

Go to `localhost:5601` to verify Kibana is running locally

Click on üîß`DevTools` on the left side navigation in Kibana

## Get started with some basic ElasticSearch API endpoints

To start playing around with Kibana, run these commands and hit the green ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button to make a request.

`GET _cat/indices` - [gets all indices](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.3/cat-indices.html)

`GET <name of index>` - [gets basic info on index](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.3/indices-get-index.html)

`GET <name of index>/_search` - returns all documents in index

`PUT <name of new index>` - [creates new index](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.3/indices-create-index.html)

## Create your own index

#### Creating documents

ElasticSearch [automatically creates an index](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.3/docs-index_.html#index-creation) when a new document is created for an index that doesn't exist yet:

```
POST my_new_pet_index/dogs
{
  "name": "Lulu",
  "age": 2,
  "birthdate": "2019-01-03"
}
```

Run `GET my_new_pet_index` to verify your new index exists.

Create a new document and specify an id:

```
POST my_new_pet_index/dogs/1
{
  "name": "Teddy",
  "age": 3,
  "birthdate": "2019-03-22"
}
```

Run both requests again and take note of the `created` property in the response.

Run `GET my_new_pet_index/_search` to see how many documents are in the index.

#### Updating documents

[Update a document](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.3/docs-update.html) by making a `PUT` request and specifying an id to update in the params:

```
PUT my_new_pet_index/dogs/1
{
  "name": "Theodore",
  "age": 3,
  "birthdate": "2019-03-22",
  "a_new_field": true
}
```

#### Mappings

#### Deleting indices

## Search and the Query DSL

#### Setup

Using ElasticSearch's [Bulk API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.3/docs-bulk.html), create a new index with multiple documents to build a searchable index.

Copy and paste the fake restaurant review data [here](https://github.com/kickstarter/elastic-search-workshop/blob/master/resources/bulk_index_data.md) and add it to the body of your bulk request.

```
POST fake_restaurants/_reviews/_bulk
