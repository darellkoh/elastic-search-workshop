It can get pretty busy with 30 min wait times. I recommend checking the website and see how busy their store is.","city":"New Raymondefort","created_at":"2019-03-27","delivery":false}

The drinks looked creative so I made it a point to give it try while in the city. Located inside American Eagle in Times Square they serve up the coolest non-alcoholic beverages. You have an array of options from tea, soda, coffee, latte, water and more. Theres countertops (with phone chargers) so youre able to stand and enjoy your beverage. This visit I opted for the Pegasus latte which was not only beautiful but tasted just as good as it looked. Great staff and great service. This is a must try if you are in the area. Im sure Ill be back soon!","city":"Luettgenport","created_at":"2019-06-18","delivery":false}
